# Covid-plots

This R code plots data pulled from the European Centers for Disease Control (ECDC) as well as the COVID Tracking project.  The code transforms cases and deaths to cases and deaths per 100 and plots US states (with and without NY, NJ, CT and MA) and EU countries as well as continental Europe.

The pdf plots were from data pulled on 8/22/2020.  To get up-to-date plots, simply run the code and it will pull the data from ECDC and COVID Tracking Project.
